                    <p class="project-p">In the redesign of Tazo Tea packaging the goal was to create a more environmentally friendly package. In-order to achieve this the box size is reduced from the original size and all of the products used in the packaging are environmentally friendly and biodegradable including the plastic and mesh used for the tea bags.</p>

                <div class="unit unit-xs-1 unit-s-1 unit-m-1-2 unit-l-2-3">
                    <img src="img/piece4/piece4-1-01.jpg" class="project-pic">                
                </div>

                <div class="unit unit-xs-1 unit-s-1 unit-m-1-2 unit-l-1-3">
                    <p class="project-p">One of the features that this packaging includes is a world map that becomes visible as the tea bags are taken out. Tazo has a huge focus on the quality of their products and pride themselves on using the best ingredients for all over the world.  This new packaging highlights on the map the specific countries where each tea flavours products are from.</p>

                <div class="unit unit-xs-1 unit-s-1 unit-m-1-2 unit-l-2-3">
                    <img src="img/piece4/piece4-2-01.jpg" class="project-pic">
                </div>

                <div class="unit unit-xs-1 unit-s-1 unit-m-1-2 unit-l-1-3">
                    <p class="project-p">Another key feature of this package design is the teabag tag. The tag solves the issue of the teabag falling into a cup of tea by having a notch that hooks on the rim of the mug. It also reiterates the brand.</p>
