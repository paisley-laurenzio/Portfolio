                    <p class="project-p">For the look and feel of this piece the goal was to depict the mountains data in a graphically pleasing and engaging way while keeping it sleek and polished. To achieve this a monochromatic blue colour pallet was used for the intro video with the graphics overlaid in white so that they blend, creating an overall unified look to the piece.</p>
